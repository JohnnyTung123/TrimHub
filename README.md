Project Overview

TrimHub is an innovative online platform designed exclusively for the salon community,
offering a dynamic space where salons and clients can connect, share experiences, and stay
updated on the latest trends in the fashion industry. As a web-based application, customers can
search their favorite barbershop, book haircut services and make payment online. Moreover,
customers can express personal opinions to a particular salon. On the other hand, salons can
promote businesses by uploading descriptions, photos and videos to their profiles.
